Our favourites are their La Gourmande and Aumoniere. I've tried their galettes (savoury crepes) as well but I didn't really like them because I found them mostly too dry to eat with their savoury pairings. The dessert crepes usually have sauce or ice cream which makes them much more appetizing.Price wise, crepe ingredients aren't really expensive so the profit margin is pretty high on their prices, but their prices are within range of most other creperies around. Yes, you do pay for the technique of crepe making, but I don't think these are the best crepes - I've had others that blow me away every time.\"],\n",

I wish I could say my experience here was positive but unfortunately the service was a huge disappointment. I thoroughly enjoyed my food when it finally arrived, so maybe consider coming here when they‚Äôre not busy as they‚Äôre really not good at handling a queue.I showed up with two other people where there was already a young family waiting. The waitress greeted us and told us that it would be a short wait. We noticed there was a party of three already seated with an empty table next to them. We assumed they were perhaps waiting for more friends to arrive and fill those empty seats but they ended up having their entire meal with a spare table next to them while the laneway filled up with more groups waiting for tables. All of us in the queue were perplexed as to why no one was being seated at the spare table. I even asked the waitress if the table next to them was free but she simply shrugged and said she didn‚Äôt know before rushing off.As a table became free a waitress told us we could take it but there was the young family who had been waiting longer than us that just hadn‚Äôt been acknowledged by the staff. We let that family take that table and we ended up waiting 15 minutes longer for the group who was inexplicably taking up two tables to leave. When we sat down, two people sat at the table next to us but then asked to move as it was quite sunny. A few minutes later though, the staff asked them to move back to the sunny table to accommodate a larger group when they could have simply moved the table into a shaded spot.The staff‚Äôs methods were very puzzling to me and I could not work out why they seemed to have zero consideration for their customers and zero experience in efficiently managing a busy restaurant.'],\n",

       "  \"With my friend going away to Paris in September, we decided that we would make it an initiative to go to as many French places as possible before her big trip. Having a hankering for crepes, especially since the last one I had was in Paris, a large thick super creamy cheesy crepe with spinach and ricotta that had me bursting at the seams, I couldn't wait to try some crepe in a french cafe in Melbourne.Lucky for us, Roule Galette is open till late on Saturday evenings. It is tucked away in a laneway just off Flinders Lane.Despite it being chilly, we decided to sit outside as the aircon was going on in the inside, and it is quite cramped inside. Would not recommend this place for big groups. As soon as we sat down, our friendly waitress arrived with two large menus. My oh my - the options for crepes are endless.So many options for both savoury and sweet crepes. For maximum value, my friend and I decided to share. We got their chef's recommendation - the lamb crepe with caramelized onion as our savoury option and the goat's cheese honey crepe for our sweet option.The crepes arrived quite quickly. Both crepes come with green salads, which are just delicious. The one that came with the goat's cheese crepe had walnuts on it.The lamb crepe had chunky,s chewy deliciously flavoured pieces of lamb that were balanced with the sweetness from the caramelised onion. Couldn't help myself from shovelling it into my mouth. The goat's cheese crepe with honey had just a tinge of sweetness to it. No filling in it really but delicious.The crepes were gone in minutes and were half the size and 1/4th the thickness of the one I had had in Paris but delicious - really delicious.Would definitely go back to try some more.Crepes range from 15-22 bucks and though I think they're expensive, they are probably right for Melbourne's exorbitant food prices.You get charged 50c for using your card. Split billing is allowed.The interior walls are plastered with Le Canard Unchaine (The unchained duck?) newspaper snippets. Unlike most french cafes, they don't sell any pastries.Definitely worth a visit! :)\"],\n",

The galette itself was thin and crispy, and the best bits were the edges with melted cheese!!My friend had the La Roule Galette Complete, which was similarly full of flavour. I haven't had ham and cheese for a long time and this dish reminded me@ of why it's such a classic and loved everywhere.Service was attentive and welcoming from the lovely waitress and waiter.

It was very enjoyable. The traditional French apple cider is worth trying too. A bit different to any other apple ciders. It's a bit dry and not as sweet, I really liked it, and went well with the food. My friend had a pork sausage one, and it was amazing also.

We were completely mesmerized with the amount of options so we had to ask for the help of the waiter in order to be happy with our choice.We ordered a couple of lattes and we settled with the LA COMPLETE (egg, ham and emmental cheese) crepe.Our coffees were nice however, do not expect boutique coffee here. This is not the type of venue to boast or be fussy with your coffee knowledge. Just a nice commercial beverage alongside your meal. Our crepe arrived shortly after. It was a little overcooked on the outside but very nice, soft and juicy on the inside. Definitely one of the greatest crepes we have ever had.The venue is really old and we noticed that the door was extremely narrow. The tables very old style and the place looks a bit messy on the inside, if not unclean.The biggest let-down was the service. The only waiter on the day of our visit was very slow and quite abrupt with his service. He didn't look very stressed out regarding the fact that he was serving customers by himself, on the contrary, his expression was quite indifferent. As a result, the items ordered did not arrive until a lot later which created a bit of a disadvantage for the venue.We will be definitely returning to try more and hopefully, we will be faced with some more speed and smiles.\"],\n",

       "  \"...we headed to Roule Galette, an adorable little French creperie off one of the many lanes in the Melbourne CBD. Never mind that we just ate our fill at Don Don , because there is always room for dessert! We ordered a simple Sugar and Butter Crepe ($4) to share between the two of us. As you can see, the crepe was thin and delicate, the edges crispy and almost lacy, and becoming every so slight chewy as you work your way into the middle. The thin smear of butter in the crepe, as well as the sugar sprinkled on top made this a delicious, yet light dessert, and far too soon, it was all gone. But what I like the most about Roule Galette is not their crepes, or their galettes for that matter (though don't get me wrong, both are absolutely delicious!), but the charm of the tiny place, as well as the waiters themselves. The space consists of no more t\\n                                                                ...\"],\n",

The prices are very reasonable and thankfully the French waiters don't live up to their rather unfavourable stereotypes and are friendly and helpful. We shared the Forrestiere (bacon, mushroom, cheese and B√©chamel) and the Popeye (cheese, spinach, mushroom). The Forrestiere was unpleasantly salty while the Popeye had a much better balance - was the bacon the culprit?? Good for a cheap, easy meal anyway.\"],\n",

It was 8am and nobody was in, I couldn\\'t find any staff either so I decided to walk in to check it out, there was music playing ( really nice music that makes you feel like in France, which I\\'ve been told later that it was the music from the movie Amelie) but nobody there. After a few seconds a head popped out of the back, a young man great me with a smile and and warm \"Morning\", he offered me to have a sit while he was finishing what he was doing( I guess cooking as he was alone) which didn\\'t take more than a minute, offered me a coffee( which was beautiful and delicious, love latte art but even more a good coffee) and gave me a menu. As I didn\\'t know much about creps and galette I asked him about it and I\\'ll tell you what, I\\'ve hardly ever seen a young man so knowledgeable about food. I started making me a delicious savoury galette as we kept talking and he was giving some cooking tips, a real french cuisine lesson and historical lesson about crepes, all what he didn\\'t know as I was really asking for a lot, like the meaning of the flag of brittany, we googled it as he sat for a coffee with me. He then proceeded to make me a caramel crepe, which the caramel was made by himself, DELICIOUS, I\\'ve never had a better one, and he also gave me the recipe (shhhh, it\\'s a secret recipe).Anyway, good food for good value, good coffee, and outstanding service, I tip my hat to this young man whom by himself made this breakfast one of the best I had in a cafe in my life, and love the french accent !!'],\n",

I wouldn't have minded it so much if it wasn't for the fact that we got up to get menus (it was 8:30 on a Tuesday night and it was virtually empty) and after waiting for a good 10 minutes, we got up to order because no one was coming to our table. They told us that they didn't take orders at the counter and we would have to wait until someone came to our table. 10 minutes later, someone did and we ordered (again, the place was EMPTY).After we finished our crepes ,we wanted a sweet one but we didn't know what to do because EVERY staff member was sitting in the table next to us having a cigarette. We gave them a few hints and after waiting for a while we just told them we wanted a chocolate and banana crepe for desert. One of the staff members got up, gave us uhhhhhs and started making the crepe.To sum it all up, the service is beyond terrible but the crepes are good.
